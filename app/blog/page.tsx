      description: `
The AI Hospital Management System is a comprehensive platform designed to transform hospital operations. It uses artificial intelligence to optimize patient scheduling, manage records, predict patient inflow, and streamline administrative tasks. 

With predictive analytics, the system forecasts bed availability and medicine inventory, reducing shortages and delays. Doctors and nurses get real-time insights, while administrators monitor performance via dashboards. 

By integrating patient records, lab results, and pharmacy data, it enables proactive decision-making, enhancing efficiency and patient care.

This project trains machine learning models to predict car prices based on a dataset including features like engine size, horsepower, fuel type, and body style. Multiple models were tested, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. 

Feature engineering, data visualization, and model evaluation were performed. Random Forest achieved the best performance with 92% RÂ². SHAP values were used for explainability, highlighting the impact of each feature.
